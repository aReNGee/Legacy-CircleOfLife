		<p>'Circle of Life' was produced by Game Programming Squad, a team from Humber College. <br> <br>
	Game Programming Squad Members: Miguel Favero, Lucas Kanabe, Ivan Boyko <br><br>

	About the team: <br>
	We are all first year Game Programming students at Humber College. We did not have any previous coding experience before starting our program. We built our game using the skills we learned from our first semester in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
	<br> <br>
	This is our first time coming to the Game Jam, but we've had a lot of fun and learned a lot!
	<br> <br>
	Thanks for playing our game! We hope to see you again next year!</p>
