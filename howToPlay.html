		<p>How To Play:</p>
		<p>You have three plant plots, with each one reacting differently to the four types of weather. In addition, the reaction of the plots to the weather conditions are also different depending on the season.</p>
		<p>Your job is to adjust the weather during the seasons by performing one of the four rituals (rain, sun, wind, clouds) so that all three of your plant plots grow fully through all nine stages. Once all three plants grow completely, you win the game!</p>
		<p>However, you can only chose the weather conditions by performing the rituals for one of your three plots each turn! The remaining two plots are given a weather condition at random, so chose wisely which plot to focus on.</p>
		<p>Try to beat the game in the lowest amount of turns, to make it higher on the leaderboard! Good Luck!</p>
